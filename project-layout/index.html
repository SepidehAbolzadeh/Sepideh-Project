        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear
        or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.[4] It is
        characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name
        "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a
        neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the
        giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more
        than 99% of its diet.[5] Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other
        grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or
        carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub
        leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.The giant
        panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in
        Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.

        As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant
        panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and
        it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.[9][10] A 2007 report
        showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27
        outside the country.[11] By December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in
        captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 countries.[12] Wild
        population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590
        individuals living in the wild,[11] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis
        estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.
